# Animal Trading Card - Web Development Project

This project is a simple interactive webpage featuring a trading card for an animal. The project was designed to practice front-end web development skills, focusing on HTML and CSS.

## Project Overview

The Animal Trading Card project displays a card with an animal's name, image, interesting facts, and a brief description. The layout and design follow a prototype, and custom styles were applied to enhance the visual appearance of the card. This project is a demonstration of basic HTML structure and custom CSS styling.

## Features

- **HTML5**: Structured the content of the card, including animal details.
- **CSS3**: Applied styles to create an engaging, responsive card with custom background colors, border-radius, and box shadows.
- **Responsive Design**: The card is optimized for display on different screen sizes and ensures proper resizing of images and content.
- **Single Page Application**: All content is displayed on one webpage.
